            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Advice TO PROTESTANT DISSENTERS, Shewing 'Tis their Intereſt to Repeal the <hi>Teſt,</hi> upon the offer the <hi>King</hi> makes by a firm ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Liberty.</head>
            <p>PENAL LAWS are of ſo ill a Conſequence, in the Hands of any Party, and ſo uneaſie to be parted with by that which predominates, that 'tis diſcretion in <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to take this oppertunity for the Repeal, now we have a <hi>Prince</hi> to joyn with us to do it, when ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity may offer again is uncertain; therefore to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this will be their Intereſt at the next Seſſions, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better terms we are not like to obtain it, becauſe we have a <hi>Prince</hi> that wants it for his own Communion.</p>
            <p>But 'twill be Objected, <hi>The</hi> Penal Laws <hi>will readily be conſented to, but that cannot be done without we take off the</hi> Teſt <hi>too; the conſequence of which will be greater Prejudice then the inconveniency of keeping the</hi> Penal Laws; <hi>how that will appear, when we conſider the</hi> King <hi>has promiſed a ſettlement that is unalterable, and indeed 'tis his Wiſdom ſo to do, if he values the Liberty of his own Religion in an after Raign,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107976:2"/>which may fall out to be in an Averſion to</hi> Popery, <hi>that may then endeavour the ſuppreſſing it again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis from, or however cannot be without the conſent of the <hi>King,</hi> that we muſt have this Liberty; Is it equal to expect it from him, without giving his Community the ſame Advantages? Shall we ask that of him that we will not allow his? 'tis unfair: Beſides, the <hi>Teſt</hi> in the nature of it is unreaſonable, becauſe it puts a Man upon a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deny that which he believes he cannot be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out believing.</p>
            <p>It may be Objected, <hi>It only hinders them from getting or keeping in Offices.</hi> If no more then that, 'tis unreaſonable, for 'twill amount to nothing ſhort of Perſecution. As for Example, Suppoſe a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> has a Place in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worth Five Hundred pound a Year, &amp; nothing but his Place to Live on, upon reading Books, or hearing Sermons, or diſcourſing <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he is perſwaded to their Faith, and ſo cannot take the <hi>Teſt,</hi> upon his refuſal he is turned out, and render'd uncapable of procuring Maintenance for his Family; if this is not a ſuffering for Conſcience, I know not what is.</p>
            <p>Again, ſince our Laws does not prohibit a <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> from being Heir to the Crown, why ſhould they be denyed having thoſe of their Family or Guard of the ſame? By our Laws none of that Perſwaſion can come near the Court for fear of endangering the <hi>Kings Perſon,</hi> now who is the moſt ſutuable Judge of the <hi>Kings Safety,</hi> either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or a part of his People? I think all muſt allow him, or elſe we act againſt our daily Experience and Practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for who of us would not chuſe Servants for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee when things are made partial, and not upon a Foundation of Equity, and ſhort of doing as one would be done by, that one time or other it returns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107976:2"/>
            <p>'Tis an ill thing to Teſt upon Peoples Religious Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; if we muſt have them, let it be upon an honeſt Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> For the renouncing any evil Principle, that is either immorral or pernitious to the State, and then if any Man refuſe to ſubſcribe, let him be dealt with accordingly, this would be juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould any <hi>Diſſenters</hi> boggle at the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> when 'twill never be done but with them? if ſo, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have Wiſdom enough to make things ſecure for the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> and their own <hi>Security,</hi> in a full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Religion.</hi> Cannot they conſider of ſuch a method that may for the future ſecure us from any attemps that may be made upon the violation of that general Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'tis agreed on all Hands, that Law only can ſecure us, which makes our <hi>Teſt</hi> ſo great a Bulwork; then if Law can ſecure us, why may not the Wiſdom of a Parliament think of another Security that may be more univerſal? for to be ſure that which takes in all Parties into its Intereſt is the beſt Policy, for if any Party is excluded that to be ſure will attempt upon invading the ſafety of the reſt, and if any one of theſe united Parties are Predominate, the excluded will endeavour to work in with ſome, or one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts upon promiſe of bettering them, that they may aſſiſt to exterpate that Aſſociation; but if our Settlement is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, and that no one Perſwaſion can Predominate, but all in one united Intereſt; if any Party ſhould through Ambition deſire to break this civil Bond, and try to ſet up for themſelves, all the reſt would joyn againſt any ſuch attempt, and through the diſproportion of Number muſt of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be defeated; ſo that upon the whole, nothing can brake this general Liberty, that is equally ſettled, but Force, and there can be no ſtronger Fence againſt that then Unity and Univerſallity.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107976:3"/>
            <p>It is the Intereſt of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to accept of this, and be content with it, being the only Policy they can uſe for their own Safety, becauſe they know their Number is but ſmall, and not able of themſelves to do any thing that may procure them a better Settlement. Now for People that really are for Liberty in Religion, before hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that the <hi>King</hi> will not concede to ſuch a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Parliament, I think be-ſpeaks them void of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Was it the intent of any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to give up the <hi>Teſt</hi> without an Equivolent, but rely upon Promiſes, that afterwards the Settlement ſhould be made, there would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſome grounds of Jealouſie? but as yet I never ſaw the Man that was ſo inclined; but that which Repealed the one, ſhould Ratifie and Confirm the other; if ſo, then wheres the Truſt? I find there is a ſort of People among <hi>Diſſenters</hi> that harps upon this Point, I preſume they are ſuch in whom the <hi>Church of England</hi> have by their skill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by their Inſinuations. 'Tis true, a Man would not ſtop his Ears from any thing that was reaſonable, from any one; but a wiſe Man would be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of his Adverſary, or one that ſpeaks from private Intereſt; one if not both of theſe that Church will be found in; as to the firſt, I need not go far for proof, their Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when they had Power ſufficiently proves it, and their being now unwilling to part with it in a Parliamentary way confirms it. As to the ſecond part, <hi>Private Intereſt,</hi> firſt, 'tis certain they gain nothing by this Liberty, for theirs is Eſtabliſhed, and the giving it to others will leſten them, for if theirs is a reform from <hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are a reform from them.</p>
            <p>Again, ſhall we take the fair Offers of an Enemy, that may never be capable (if willing) to perform what they promiſe, rather then imbrace the preſent Kindneſs of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107976:3"/>
               <hi>King,</hi> who offers Liberty upon our own terms, <hi>viz.</hi> laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unalterable, by no meanes; Providence has caſt it unexpectedly upon us, therefore let us not refuſe it, leaſt we be found diſpiſers of our own Mercies, by waiting for that from the <hi>Church of England</hi> that they will not hold themſelves obliged to perform; for upon whom, if we ſhould confide, can we rely? or who is that Agent for them, that they will hold themſelves obliged when capable to perform that Engagement? for my part I am at a loſs to find that Perſon or Party.</p>
            <p>But ſome may Object, <hi>Let us be careful that we diſoblige not them, leaſt they reckon with us another Day.</hi> As to that, let us conſider what we are a doing, and how we do it; as to what, 'tis Liberty only to Worſhip our God ſecurely, without interruption either by Fines or Impriſonments; next how; that we do it legally, and not with any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or deſire of infrlnging them of theirs. Now if they are diſpleaſed at this, we are ſure 'tis not from a Chriſtian Spirit that they act, and they will be found doing as they would not be done by, for no Man that is Religious deſires to be reſtrained from the exerciſe of it; but I need not ſpend time to treat of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience to Diſſenters,</hi> for that moſt Men either through Conviction or Pollicy will conſent to; but the taking away the <hi>Teſt</hi> is the great debate, for ſay the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and thoſe that give ear to their Inſinuations, <hi>If that is gone there can be no ſecurety o the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Now as to that, in a <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Raign,</hi> what ſervice is it, are they keep for all that out of Offices and Places of Truſt? No; but although we cannot prevent them of that, yet the keeping them out of the Legiſlative Power is our Security; but let me ask them one Queſtion, Have they not often charged them with theſe Doctrines, <hi>viz.</hi> Not keeping Faith with <hi>Heriticks,</hi> or that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107976:4"/>they are not obliged, or don't account that of any value or tye to them that they promiſe to us, and farther what ever they do to us, provided 'tis to ſerve <hi>Holy Church,</hi> let the Act be ever ſo immorral, 'tis Meritorious; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, I cannot ſee that great Bulwark in the <hi>Teſt</hi> that many would have us believe; for if they may have Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences for theſe enormities, I cannot believe they will be ſo ſquemiſh at the <hi>Teſt,</hi> when they find the Promotion of their <hi>Church</hi> ſo mightily depends upon taking it; ſo that I have reaſon to believe the <hi>Church of England</hi> either to be ſhort ſighted, or intends not well to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo induſtriouſly to keep them from joyning with the <hi>King</hi> in Eſtabliſhing a <hi>General Liberty;</hi> for if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> finds that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> breaks with them upon this Civil Union, will not they be obliged to betake themſelves to the ſuereſt way they can for their own ſecurity, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive will then conſiſt in one of theſe two Points, the firſt, <hi>To get a Diſpenſation to take the</hi> Teſt, <hi>or elſe to bring the</hi> Church of England <hi>into their Intereſt.</hi> As to the firſt, the <hi>Church of England</hi> tells us, as above, <hi>They can do things Tantamount;</hi> but if they have abuſied them in their Tenets, and they ſhould refuſe that way, but ſhould fall in with them, what Security can they give us that they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them into their Favour, ſince our <hi>Prince</hi> is of that Perſwaſion? who knows but their antient pretence to Loyalty may ſpring again? if ſo, from whom muſt we expect Kindneſs, for of theirs we have had woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and for the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> 'tis better joyning them when we can ſerve them, then to expect Favour from them, when we have deſerted them. Oh, that <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would but be wiſe, and take Liberty upon their own terms, and their own making, rather then to depend upon thoſe that have been and are our Enemies; for whatever they promiſe now,
<pb facs="tcp:107976:4"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:107976:5"/>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107976:5"/>I look upon it but the effect of Policy, not of Kindneſs, that we may be wheedled out of our preſent certainty for hopes of Kindneſs when they may be capable to give it; but if they ſhould ſo prevail upon the eaſineſs of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as to refuſe the preſent oppertunity; when ſuffering comes upon us again, we ſhall be obliged to take it patiently, firſt for Conſcience, next for our Follies ſake: I have for all this no ill will to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but do wiſh well to her alſo, all that I deſire is, that their ill Nature, together with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> that have put them upon doing wrong, to their Reproach, that ſhe would now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the taking away that, that when the ſame ill Nature predominates again may diſable them from doing what they have been ſo prone too; for a Man that is convicted of an Evil, will endeavour to ſhun the oppertunity of a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and until the <hi>Church of England</hi> comes ſo far, that is to be willing to part with that Peſtilence they have been ſo infected with, I cannot conceive any Reformation among them. For a Man to tell me that has been given to Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, that he is Reformed, yet cannot forſake the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and his Familiers that continued in that exceſs, I ſhould have but ſmall hopes of his Reformation; and although he might decline Drinking for the preſent, I ſhould only judg it ſome. Indiſpoſition, for no Man loves to keep up that which he Loathes; ſo it I would abandon Perſecution I ſhall be willing to part with that which would tollerate me in it, for fear of a Temptation; and when we ſee the <hi>Church of England</hi> willing to part with all <hi>Penal Laws for Religion,</hi> we may have hopes they are not in love with <hi>Severity,</hi> and till then 'tis in vain to pretend to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for Actions ſpeaks louder then Words, and Performance is better then Promiſes. I look upon it a meer wheedle in the <hi>Church of England</hi> to tell us, they are for giving <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107976:6"/>of Conſcience,</hi> and yet oppoſe the <hi>Teſts</hi> being taken away, for to be ſure they conclude themſelves ſafe in the offer; for me to offer that which I imagine will not be accepted is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame with no offer, which is the caſe of them. As for Example, If I proffer a Man Fifty Pounds to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of a Perſon, that 'tis at his pleaſure to pay it or no, and 'tis evident the doing it will prove inconvenient to his Affairs; how unlikely would it be that he ſhould comply with the payment? Juſt ſo is the offer the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> makes to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> they promiſe to Repeal the <hi>Penal Statutes,</hi> which they cannot perform but with the Concurrance of the <hi>King;</hi> and is it likely it ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that way, without taking off the <hi>Teſt</hi> too? for can we expect he ſhould ſet us quite free, and continue Bonds upon his one Communion?</p>
            <p>'Tis eaſie for Men to offer that which is out of their power to give, and hard to get ſuch Men to part with what is in their power to keep; but thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> if the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> will, 'tis in the <hi>Kings</hi> and their power (under <hi>God</hi>) to make themſelves eaſie whether the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will or no.</p>
